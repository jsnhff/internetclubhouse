An innauguration.

A gun fires, and you see the smoke before you hear the sound. This is the first impression of the Internet Clubhouse. You're staring at the smoke, but you have yet to experience the sound.

What can you expect? I'm glad you asked. Expect ruminations on design, thoughts on design management, and the occasional rant. You mind find an interview from time to time, or a write up on a product or experience.

If you have feedback you can find me on twitter <a href="http://www.twitter.com/netclubhouse">@netclubhouse</a>.

Here we go.
